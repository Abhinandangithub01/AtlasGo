## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **On Place Detail Pages:**

When you visit any place page (e.g., `/place/taj-mahal`), the page will:

1. **Fetch all blog posts** from Storyblok
2. **Filter blogs** that have this place slug in their `related_places` array
3. **Display related blogs** in a beautiful orange-themed section
4. **Show blog cards** with:
   - Hero image thumbnail
   - Title and excerpt
   - Author and reading time
   - Category badge
   - Link to full blog post

### **Example:**

Visit: `http://localhost:3000/place/taj-mahal`

You'll see:
- **"Travel Stories About Taj Mahal"** section
- Blog card for "The Ultimate Guide to Visiting the Taj Mahal"
- Click to read the full story

**Blogs → Places:**
